# Gamer-bot
Cool Telegram bot to play rock, paper, scissor with ;)

Prerequisites:

1. To run the project successfully, you need to install the python-telegram-bot library using the command

'pip install python-telegram-bot'

(Execute this command in your command prompt/command line)

As this project uses telegram.ext package from this library.
Not doing so may result in error :(

2. The project has two files main.py and commands.py.
Keep both the files in the same directory.


You just need to follow the prerequisites and use the main.py and commands.py(keep the files name same) to run your Gamer Bot.

In this program you have to enter the api key of your telegram bot to make it run.( I have kept the source code open so that anyone can deploy their own gamer bot by just entering the api key of their telegram bot)
